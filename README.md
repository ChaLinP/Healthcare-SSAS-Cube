## Overview

This project implements a SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube on top of a healthcare data warehouse modeled using a star schema. The cube allows for multidimensional analysis of healthcare metrics such as patient encounters, costs, payer coverage, and more.

It forms part of a broader DW & BI solution designed from synthetic OLTP healthcare data, transformed and loaded using SSIS.

---

## Dataset

The dataset originates from the [Synthea Project](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads), consisting of synthetic healthcare records including:

- Encounters
- Patients
- Providers
- Payers
- Organizations
- Claims
- Medications
- Immunizations, and more

These entities were transformed and loaded into a star schema, and the cube is built over that schema.

---

## Cube Design

The cube includes:

### üîπ Dimensions
- **Patient**
- **Provider**
- **Payer**
- **Date**
- **Organization**

### üîπ Measures
- **Base Encounter Cost**
- **Total Claim Cost**
- **Payer Coverage**
- **Remaining Claim Amount**
- **Total Coverage Ratio**
- **Additional Charge**

These measures enable slicing and dicing of healthcare financials across various dimensions.

## SSAS Cube Implementation

The SSAS cube was implemented using **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Multidimensional** model. The implementation followed these steps:

1. **Create an Analysis Services Multidimensional Project**  
   A new SSAS Multidimensional project was created using **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**.

2. **Create a Data Source**  
   Connected to the healthcare data warehouse in SQL Server ‚Äî this is where the cube extracts its data from.

3. **Create a Data Source View (DSV)**  
   A DSV was created to select and visualize the required fact and dimension tables along with their relationships.

4. **Create the Cube Structure**  
   A cube was created using the DSV:
   - Added the `FactEncounters` fact table
   - Added `DimPatients`, `DimProviders`, `DimPayers`, `DimOrganizations`, and `DimDate` as dimensions

5. **Configure Measures and Dimensions**  
   - Selected relevant columns to expose as **measures**
   - Added dimension attributes
   - Created hierarchies where applicable (e.g., Date hierarchy)

6. **Deploy and Process the Cube**  
   Deployed the cube to an SSAS instance and processed it to populate data, making it ready for analysis in tools like **SSMS**, **Excel**, or **Power BI**.

## üöÄ How to Deploy the Cube

1. Open **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)** or **Visual Studio with SSAS Extensions**.
2. Clone/download this repo and open the SSAS project solution file.
3. Connect to your local or remote SSAS instance.
4. Deploy and process the cube.
5. Use **SSMS**, **Excel**, or other BI tools to browse and analyze the cube.

## Sample Database (.bak)

To work with the cube, restore the provided backup file:

üì• **[Download healthcare_dw.bak](./Medical_DW.bak)**

### Restore Instructions

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Right-click **Databases** ‚Üí **Restore Database...**
3. Select **Device** and choose the `.bak` file.
4. Click **OK** to restore.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the SQL Server service account has access to the file path.
